# HER_Builds
HER - a História de Eliza Resner was a project developed at the end of the IT Technic Course at ETEC Philadelpho Gouvêa Netto, in Brazil.
___
This project is a Unity game, made in 6 months, with close to zero starting Unity editor knowledge and a group of 4 people willing to stay awake until 2AM dealing with Imaging software being buggy.
 The game development stopped after the final presentation because everyone took a different way in their lives, i'm releasing this source code, and two "Working" builds, as an attempt to keep these good memories alive.
 
That said, this source code (which can be found in the ```src``` folder), was developed some time ago and i never looked back to refactor it, some parts are commented, some parts are TREMENDOUSLY HORRIBLE to understand. I'm leaving the code and the builds online just for reference.

The latest working build was made in Unity 5.3.2f1 and newer versions of unity may not work the way it's supposed to. If you just want to play the game, download the latest release.
___
Developed by LightThe, with 3 other friends. I made most of the source code :D
